Consider an arbitrary planar trajectory, $\mathbf{Q}_{2 \times N}$, through a series of waypoints, seen in red in figure 
\ref{fig:TRJ_TrajGen}. Starting from point $A$, displacements between elements were summed along 
the path until the desired footstep magnitude was reached at point $B$.

At $B$ a circle, $C$, with a diameter equal to the hip width of the robot was constructed. The circle
was then bisected by a line normal to $AB$; $DE$.

\begin{align}
    y = (\nabla_{AB})^{-1} \cdot (x - x_{B}) + y_{B}    \label{eq:TRJ_Line}   \\
    r^{2} = (x - x_{B})^{2} + (y - y_{B})^{2}           \label{eq:TRJ_Circ}
\end{align}
The equations for line $DE$ and circle $C$, \ref{eq:TRJ_Line} and \ref{eq:TRJ_Circ} respectively, 
can solved for $Y$ and equated to form the quadratic equation:

\begin{align}
    \alpha x^{2} - 2x \cdot x_{B} \alpha + \alpha x^{2}_{B} - r^{2} \label{eq:TRJ_Quad} \\
    \alpha = 1 + (\nabla_{AB})^{-2}
\end{align}

The quadratic formula was then used to find the roots of equation \ref{eq:TRJ_Quad}, which
are the %X% components of the intersections between $DE$ and $C$. At this point, $\alpha$ was 
substituted back into the equation to yield:

\begin{align}
    X_{DE \cap C} = x_{B} \pm r \cdot (\nabla_{AB}) \sqrt{(\nabla^{2}_{AB} + 1)^{-1}}    \label{eq:TRJ_X} \\
    Y_{DE \cap C} = y_{B} \mp r \cdot \sqrt{(\nabla^{2}_{AB} + 1)^{-1}}                  \label{eq:TRJ_Y}
\end{align}

The coordinates $(X_{DE \cap C},Y_{DE \cap C})$ form two possible footstep positions differing only 
in the sign of the component added to $B_{(x,y)}$. 
\newline
The accumulated distance was then reset, and $A$ set to $B$, before returning to iterating along the 
trajectory until the magnitude of footstep was reached. Equations \ref{eq:TRJ_X} and \ref{eq:TRJ_Y} were
then applied at a new value of $B_{(x,y)}$ to yield a second pair of footstep positions. This process of 
iterating along the trajectory, and generating footsteps, continued until the trajectory's end, where 
the process was repeated once more with $B_{(x,y)} = \mathbf{Q}_{(:,n)}$.

Taking the midpoint between the robot's feet as the origin of an arbitrary planar trajectory, a path to an location is 
defined.
