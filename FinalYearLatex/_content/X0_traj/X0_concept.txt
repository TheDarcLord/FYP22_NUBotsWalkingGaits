Considering an arbitrary planar trajectory through a series of waypoints, as seen in [FIGURE] in [RED].
Starting from point [A], displacements between elements were summed along the path until the 
desired footstep magnitude was reached at point [B].

At [B] a circle [C] with a diameter equal to the hip width of the robot was constructed. The circle
was then bisected circle by a line normal to AB; DE.

Given the equations for line DE and circle [C] [equations] the two intersections between C and DE, were 
determined by setting [equation 1] = [equation 2]

This simplified to following quadratic, where the roots of the equation define the X components of D and E.

The y components of D and E can found by substituting the X components back into the equation 
for line DE.

This resulted in two possible footstep positions differing only in the sign of the component added to [B].

The accumulated distance was then reset, before returning to iterating along the trajectory again until
the magnitude of footstep was reached. The aforementioned process was then repeated to yield a second pair of
footstep positions, before again iterating along the trajectory.

Upon reaching the last element of the trajectory, the process is repeated once more with [B](x,y) = Q(end).

Taking the midpoint between the robot's feet as the origin of an arbitrary planar trajectory, a path to an location is 
defined.
