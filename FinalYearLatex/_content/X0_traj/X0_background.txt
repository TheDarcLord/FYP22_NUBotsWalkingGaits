Given the context of RoboCup, it is assumed that the robot will always be walking on a planar surface. 
As such, it would be convenient to have a method for guiding the robot from its current position 
to another in cartesian space. For most mobile robots the easiest method is the use of trajectory
planning, as prescribed in \emph{Robotics}\citep{grimble_2009_robotics}. However, simple trajectory planning 
is not a convenient method for guiding a bipedal robot. Here, Kajita\citep{kajita_2002_a} initially 
turned to pattern generation using the period of an inverted pendulum to define the proceeding step. 
Later he turned to Preview Control of the ZMP\citep{kajita_2003_biped} to generate 
subsequent steps. However, neither method adequately caters for trajectory tracking.
