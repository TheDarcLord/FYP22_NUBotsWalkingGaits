$\mathbf{REF}$, mentioned in both algorithm \ref{alg:Glb2Fts} and \ref{alg:Loc2Fts}, stores a discrete 
time ZMP Reference which drives Kajita's proposed ZMP pattern generator, seen in figure \ref{fig:TRJ_ZMP}.

In order to the use preview control to drive the position of the centre of mass, algorithm \ref{alg:Loc2Fts}
had to be decomposed and implemented in two distinct phases. First the ZMP preview reference was generated, in
much the same way as algorithm \ref{alg:Glb2Fts}. This was then followed by transforming not only the global 
trajectory, but the ZMP preview reference as well into coordinate system of the $Base$. This process has been 
separated into three algorithms for clarity.
