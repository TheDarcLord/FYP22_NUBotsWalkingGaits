The method described above may seem superfluous, where it not for the fact $\mathbf{REF}$, 
mentioned in both algorithm \ref{alg:Glb2Fts} and \ref{alg:Loc2Fts}, stores a discrete 
time ZMP Reference which drives Kajita's proposed ZMP pattern generator, as seen in 
figure \ref{fig:TRJ_ZMP}.

With this in mind both algorithms were updated to extend $\mathbf{REF}$ by the number 
of timesteps the preview controller was operating on ahead of the current timestep.
