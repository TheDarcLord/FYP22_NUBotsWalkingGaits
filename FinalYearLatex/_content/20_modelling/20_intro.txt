This section outlines the development of a simplified 2D model, which was used to gain experience in
implementing locomotion strategies, and a simplified 3D model. As the focus was simulating different 
walking strategies, each model is comprised of the lower half of a humanoid, that being the feet, legs and 
waist. Both models were constructed with a series of homogenous transforms that described the position 
of the free foot, the end effector, with respect to the fixed foot, the base.
