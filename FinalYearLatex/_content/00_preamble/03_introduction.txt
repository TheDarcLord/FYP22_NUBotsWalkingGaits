In the western world the pursuit of creating autonomous humanoids began with the Greeks.

NuBots

Problem:


%%Position:
NuBots require more Mechatronics Students for the long march to a team of functioning robots. NuBots
have not excelled internationally for many years, and continue to struggle with the locomotion problem.
\\
%%Problem:
I have no experience solving the locomotion problem, despite my interest in it. In order to accelerate 
developement of walking solutions, an interface between matlab and a NuGus, allowing the running of open 
loop trajectories and joint variables in realtime, would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, if a solution
to the lack of rigidity of the 3D printed legs could make use of their elasticity, the NuBots team could field
its full team of robots.
\\
%%Proposal:
Developing my understanding of the locomotion problem, by simulating well known solutions, will make 
me an asset to the team.
