The pursuit of creating autonomous humanoids began with the Ancient Greeks \citep{rtruitte_2015_medieval}. 
Hephaestus, god of blacksmithing, created tripedal automata with golden wheels to serve the other gods of Mount
Olympus, as well as the Talos, a giant bronze humanoid. Automata and mechanisms were cherished in the world 
of the Ancient Greeks, as teaching tools, and artworks. However, these were primarily constructed of pipes,
rope, pulleys, and levers. As such, the definition of automata is a machine that completes a singular task, 
repeatedly.

Following the Greeks, the Islamic world became the home of mechanisms and automata. Ismail al-Jazari, a 12th 
century polymath, is credited with creating the first humanoid automata. These included a wine serving
girl and a band of four players \citep{rtruitte_2015_medieval}.

In the 14th century mechanical clocks melded with simple automata, which began a revolution in 
the design amd powering of humanoid automata. This culminated in examples such as Leonardo Da Vinci's 
Clockwork Knight \citep{moran_2006_the} from the 1490s and Gianello della Torre's series of praying monks 
\citep{king_2002_clockwork} in the 1560s.

Following World War Two, and the development of the first computer, Colossus, at Bletchley Park, 
Humanoid Automata drifted into Humanoid Robotics. The latter being distinguished by the
capacity to program a Robot for a series of unrelated tasks, while automata were designed to excel
at a single task.

\citet{kat_1973_development} developed the first walking humanoid robots. The WaBot series,
which began in the early 1970s, explored statically stable locomotion, object manipulation,
human to robot communication. During this period Kato became aware of Miomir VukobratoviÄ‡'s work 
on dynamically stable systems. This lead to the development of WL-10RD by Kato and his team, which
was the first dynamically stable walking humanoid robot.

In the late 1980s Mark Raibert, base at MIT's `Leg Lab', devised a new method of locomotion
with his development of a spring-loaded inverted pendulum. This robot, the Raibert Hopper \citep{raibert_1986_legged}, 
was the first of series from Raibert and the `Leg Lab' team. Today, what was the MIT `Leg Lab'
in the 1980s has formed the Boston Dynamics, with Raibert as its head. Boston Dynamic 
is currently at the forefront of humanoid research and development, with their robot Atlas.

RoboCup \citep{robocupfederation_2020_robocup} was established in 1997 as a competition 
between university research groups, with the objective of developing a humanoid football
to compete with the Football World Cup victors of that year. To drive development, the RoboCup
has a yearly football competition. This competition is split into different classes; Humanoid, 
Standard Platform, Middle Size, Small Size and now, Simulation.

NUbots \citep{nubots_2022_nubots} is the University of Newcastle's RoboCup team, and Robotics 
research group. Their current platform, Nugus, is based on the iGus Open Platform 
\citep{bonnuniversityinstituteforcomputerscience_university} developed by Bonn University.

NUbots currently runs a machine learned walk referred to as `The Quintic Walk' by the members of the team.
However, this walk causes serious oscillation within the rest of the platform's body. Additionally,
this walk engine has become a black box to the members of the team. To manage this, the
team has sunk hundreds of hours into simulating and executing various sets of tuning parameters 
that lead to a somewhat stable walk. In addition, they have built a Webots simulation of 
the Nugus platform. 

The subject of this report is the exploration of both statically stable and dynamically stable walking
methods for the Nugus platform. In order to increase the utility of either approach, a novel method 
of traveling along a specified trajectory will also be developed, alongside an interface to 
enable the rapid validation of a walking routine within the Webots environment or on the
Nugus Platform itself, without first implementing the routine in C++. This work should 
lead to a walking engine for NUbots, that is transparent, enables the rapid validation of 
future walking routines, and most importantly results in the Nugus platform walking.
