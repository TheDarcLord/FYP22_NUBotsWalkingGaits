The pursuit of creating autonomous humanoids began with the Ancient Greeks \citep{truitt_2015_medieval}. 
Hephaestus, god of smithing, created tripedal automata with golden wheels to serve the other gods of Mount
Olympus, as well as the Talos, a giant bronze humanoid. Automata and mechanisms were cherished in the world 
of the Ancient Greeks, as teaching tools, and artworks. However, these were primarily constructed of pipes,
rope, pulleys and levers. As such, the definition of automata is a machine that completes a singular task, 
repeatedly.

Following the Greeks, the Islamic world became the home of mechanisms and automata. Ismail al-Jazari, a 12th 
century polymath, is credited with creating the first humanoid automata. These included a wine serving
girl and a band of four players.

In the 14th century mechanical clocks melded with simple automata, which began a revolution in 
the powering and design of humanoid automata. This culminated in examples such as Leonardo Da Vinci's 
Clockwork Knight \citep{moran_2006_the} from the 1490s and Gianello della Torre's series of praying monks 
\citep{king_2002_clockwork} in the 1560s.

Following World War Two, and the development of the first computer, Colossus, at Bletchley Park, 
Humanoid Automata drifted into Humanoid Robotics. The latter being distinguished by the
capacity to program a Robot for a series of unrelated tasks, while the former is only ever designed 
to do one.

Problem:


%%Position:
NuBots require more Mechatronics Students for the long march to a team of functioning robots. NuBots
have not excelled internationally for many years, and continue to struggle with the locomotion problem.
\\
%%Problem:
I have no experience solving the locomotion problem, despite my interest in it. In order to accelerate 
developement of walking solutions, an interface between matlab and a NuGus, allowing the running of open 
loop trajectories and joint variables in realtime, would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, if a solution
to the lack of rigidity of the 3D printed legs could make use of their elasticity, the NuBots team could field
its full team of robots.
\\
%%Proposal:
Developing my understanding of the locomotion problem, by simulating well known solutions, will make 
me an asset to the team.
