This project examines the development and implementation of quasistatic and dynamically stable approaches to 
the bipedal walking problem. This includes the development of a novel algorithm to enable a 
bipedal robot to successfully follow an arbitrary, time delineated, planar trajectory. The
sequence of footsteps generated by this algorithm is also time delineated, such that the 
robot will reach points along the trajectory at the specified time.

The quasistatic approach to walking consists of a numerical optimisation problem, representing the inverse kinematic model, 
subject to both nonlinear equality and nonlinear inequality constraints. The numerical optimisation problem
forces the centre of mass to the locus of the support polygon, thus making the robot stable. The
constraints enforce the pose of the robot, and limit the velocity of its centre of mass.

The dynamically stable approach to walking consists of a similar numerical optimisation problem, however, the 
position of the centre of mass is driven by the state vector of a linear inverted pendulum model, subject to preview control. 
The output of this model is a point that coincides with a desired footstep, to which the pendulum is virtually attached.
In this way, the acceleration of the centre of mass ensure the robot remains dynamically stable.

The quasistatic and dynamically stable approaches were implemented with a three-dimensional kinematic model of NUbot's 
Nugus platform. In order to validate these approaches, a Matlab function was developed to emit the joint 
variable array at each time-step to both a virtual simulation environment 
and the Nugus platform.
