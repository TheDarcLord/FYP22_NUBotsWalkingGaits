The intention of this particular, half finished, report is to convey the volume of work
I have completed this semester, in order to prove my elligiblity to continue my Final Year Project
in semester two. \\
Despite blank sections, such as background, it can be seen from the figures presented
that I have a firm understanding as to bipedal locomotion using Quasi Static and ZMP 
walking strategies. \\
Given the work I have completed thus far I am interested in exploring a Spring Loaded
Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) Model of walking. This may or may not address the 'springy'
of the NuGus with 3D printed legs, however, I feel developing a sim of such a model 
is a natural progression from ZMP and for myself. \\
I concede my ZMP implementation is a little rushed, somewhat 'cart before the horse', 
and not lacking a few logic errors, but it is close. I intend to refactor all the
matlab script I have written to date.
