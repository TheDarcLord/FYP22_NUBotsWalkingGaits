By the completion of this project I have;
\begin{itemize}
    \item Significantly improved my understanding of Numerical Optimisation.
	\item Gained a greater understanding of Kinematics.
	\item Learned TCP networking, including the establishment of servers, clients and polling for incoming connections.
	\item Developed my mathematical modelling skills.
	\item Deepened my understanding of Control Systems.
\end{itemize}
The following dot points outline the objectives this project has achieved;
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed 2D and 3D kinematic models for walking robots, and produced animations of their locomotion using Matlab.
	\item Validated my implementation of the Quasistatic approach to locomotion in a virtual simulation environment.
	\item Validated my implementation of the Dynamically Stable approach to locomotion in a virtual simulation environment.
	\item Developed a novel algorithm to enable a bipedal robot to follow an arbitrary trajectory.
	\item Enhanced the aforementioned algorithm to enable the following of complex trajectories.
	\item Enhanced the aforementioned algorithm to enable the use of Preview Control.
	\item Developed a Matlab function to communicate joint variables to either the virtual simulation environment or the robot platform.
	\item Developed a controller within the virtual simulation environment to execute joint variables on the virtual robot platform.
\end{itemize}
