I must express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Dr Joel Ferguson, for supporting me 
in my initial foray into legged robots in 2021 and for guiding me through a logical progression 
of knowledge in the field of humanoid robotics this year.

I must also thank my colleagues at both SAPHI and Ampcontrol for enabling me to work flexibly
between bouts of research and development.

Finally, I dedicate this work to my Year 12 Mathematics Teacher, Mr Gerardo Aguirre.
