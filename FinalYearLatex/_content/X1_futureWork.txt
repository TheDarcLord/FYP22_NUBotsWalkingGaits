suggest future work or improvements.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Respect Full ZMP -> Torque about Yaw Axis may have caused ZMP bounce WeBots
    \item Model interaction with the ground
    \item Explore Online Trajectory generation and tracking -> Model Based, not Circle Geometry Based
    \item Make use of mass with passive gait -> reduce energy expenditure
    \item KEEP MATHEMATICAL MODEL AND PHYSICAL MODEL DOCUMENTED AND UP TO DATE
    \item Reliance on URDF passing, great idea, doesn't work when you don't keep the model up to date.
\end{itemize}
