Future work will include;
\begin{itemize}
    \item Exploring alternative methods of utilising VukobratoviÄ‡'s Zero Moment Point equations, avoiding
        methods that simplify them, to develop a robust dynamically stable walk.
    \item Modelling interactions with the ground, particularly when using 'studs` on the sole
        of the Nugus platform.
    \item Explore model driven, online trajectory generation and tracking to enable robust locomotion.
    \item Explore the use of the mass of the robot within a less energy intensive passive gait.
    \item Ensuring the geometry and mass of the Nugus platform is up to date to reenable the use of URDF files.
    \item Exploring the possibility of driving the robot's centre of mass with a spring loaded inverted pendulum, 
        in order to achieve a method for running.
