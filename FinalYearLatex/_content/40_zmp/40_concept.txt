Zero Moment Point locomotion stems from the dynamic analysis of a humanoid robot walking.
This was first explored by Miomir Vukobratović in 1968 \citep{vukobratovi_1968_contribution}. 
Vukobratović later simplified this work to a static analysis of the relationship between
the robot's foot and the ground, coining the term `Zero Moment Point' in the process
\citep{vukobratovi_1968_contribution} (1971 ...).

Given a robot's foot planted firmly upon the ground with the entire sole in contact, it
is assumed that there is sufficient friction to prevent the foot from moving. Thus, 
the system is in some form of static equilibrium. If the CoM is not within
the bounds of the support polygon then the system is unstable, as the mass of the
robot will generate unbalanced torques about the $X$ and $Z$ axes. This is demonstrated
in figure \ref{fig:ZMP}, with the weight force $mg$ through the CoM and the resulting 
torques, ${\tau}_{mgz}$ and ${\tau}_{mgx}$, shown red. Additional torques due
to the movement of the CoM in the $XZ$ plane have been omitted for clarity, but contribute
to the destabilising torques shown in red.

\end{figure}

In order to return the system to `dynamic equilibrium', opposing torques 
must be applied about the $X$ and $Z$ axes. These, alongside their equivalent CoM accelerations,
$a_z$ and $a_x$, are shown in blue. The Zero Moment Point (ZMP), depicted in purple, is the $(x,z)$ position 
at which the sum of moments about the $X$ axis is zero and the sum of moments about the $Z$ axis is zero. 
Equation \ref{eq:ZMP} includes the omitted planar accelerations of the CoM, $\ddot x$ and $\ddot z$, in the 
determination of the ZMP as a function of restoring torques, ${\tau}_{z} = a_{x} y $ and ${\tau}_{x} = a_{z} y$.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ZMP}
    \mathbf{P_{ZMP}}{(x,z)} = \begin{bmatrix}
        {(mg)}^{-1} {(a_x y - m y \ddot x)}   \\
        {(mg)}^{-1} {(a_z y - m y \ddot z)}
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

The system is only dynamically
stable if the ZMP exists within the support polygon, shown in green, which is the area defined 
by the sole of the planted foot. If the ZMP is outside the support polygon, then the net torque
will cause the foot to lift from the ground, thus causing the robot to fall. Naturally, this
occurs when either of the restoring torques is zero while the floor projected CoM is displaced 
from the support polygon.

It should be noted that the above is a simplified approach to Vukobratović's ZMP calculation (cite 35 years in its life),
assuming that the `ankle' about which the restoring torques are applied is in the $XZ$ plane at $Y = 0$, and 
defining the coordinate system from this `ankle'.
