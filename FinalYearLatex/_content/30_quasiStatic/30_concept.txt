This section will cover the implementation of quasistatic locomotion in two and three dimensions.
Quasistatic locomotion dictates that the robot must move sufficiently slowly, 
    so that any pause in its motion has no impact on its static stability. 
To satisfy this condition, 
    the robot's ground projected CoM must always remain within the support polygon. 
To walk, 
    the robot must shift its CoM over its planted foot before stepping with the alternate foot. 
The sole of the planted foot must be parallel to the ground and completely in contact with it. 
To step,
    the alternate foot follows a predefined step trajectory from its initial position to a final position, 
    depending on the step size and intended travel direction of the robot. 
Once the alternate foot reaches the final position, 
    the CoM shifts to the position above the alternate foot. 
The newly placed alternate foot now becomes the planted foot while the formerly planted foot becomes the alternate foot. 
Subsequently, a new step trajectory is generated to be traversed by the new alternate foot. 
This cycle continues until the robot reaches the desired location.
