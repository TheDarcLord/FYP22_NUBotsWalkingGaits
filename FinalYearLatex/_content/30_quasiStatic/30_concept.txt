This section will cover the implementation of quasistatic locomotion in both 
two and three dimensions. Quasistatic locomotion dictates that the robot must move slowly enough
such that any pause in its motion has no impact on its static stability. Thus to satisfy this 
condition the robot's ground projected CoM must remain within the support polygon at all times.
In order to walk, the robot must shift its CoM over its fixed foot before stepping with the other.
The fixed foot must be parallel to, and in contact with, the ground. The stepping foot follows a 
predefined trajectory from its inital position to a final position. This final position
depends on the intended travel direction of the robot. Once reached, the CoM then shifts to 
the new position, before the robot takes a subsequent step. This cycle continues until 
the robot reaches a desired location.
