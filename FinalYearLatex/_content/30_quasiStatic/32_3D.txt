The three dimensional model offers new challenges and new options in terms of quasistatic
locomotion. Modifications are made to the IKM and step trajectory generation in order to 
exploit as much of the work completed in section \ref{sec:2D_QS}. \\

Rather than walking in a straight line, the robot shall now `follow' a trajectory. The method 
used to convert a trajectory into a series of foot steps is found in section \ref{sec:NovelTraj}.
