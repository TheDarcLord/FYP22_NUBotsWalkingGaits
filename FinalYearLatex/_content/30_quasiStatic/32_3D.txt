The three dimensional model offers new challenges and new options in terms of quasistatic
locomotion. Modifications are made to the IKM and step trajectory generation in order to 
exploit as much of the work completed in section \ref{sec:2D_QS} as possible.\\

Rather than walking in a straight line, the robot shall now `follow' a trajectory. The method 
used to convert an arbitrary trajectory into a series of foot steps is found in section \ref{sec:NovelTraj}.

\subsubsection*{Three Dimensional Inverse Kinematic Model}
In three dimensions there are aspects of the robot's posture that are desirable to control. 
The priority is to keep the robot's torso vertical. Ensuring its waist perpendicular to the trajectory 
it is traveling along is desirable, but is not necessarily possible from the initial posture
of the robot.\\

A closer inspection of Figure \ref{fig:3D_1} is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:3D_pair}. On the
left, in green, $\vec{r}^{B}_{5}(\mathbf{q})$ is the position vector associated with the transform 
$\mathbf{T^B_5}(\mathbf{q})$. Additionally two unit vectors, $\mathbf{e_x}$ and $\mathbf{e_z}$, are projected 
from the base coordinate system.

\begin{figure}[!h]

        \caption{$ \vec{r}^{B}_{5} (\mathbf{q}) $ and two positions systems constructed from it}
        \label{fig:3D_pair}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

On the right, in purple, we have two additional vectors, $\vec{r}^{B}_{5a}$ and $\vec{r}^{B}_{5b}$ that 
were constructed from $\mathbf{T^B_5}$ by multiplying $\mathbf{T^B_5}$ by the homogenous transforms
found in equations \ref{eq:rbl5a} and \ref{eq:rbl5b}. Thus both $\vec{r}^{B}_{5a}$ and $\vec{r}^{B}_{5b}$
share the orientation of $\mathbf{T^B_5}$.

\begin{align}
    \mathbf{T^B_5}_a &= \mathbf{T^B_5} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
        \mathbf{I}_{3 \times 3}     &   [0, 0, 1]^\top   \\
        \mathbf{0}_{1 \times 3}     &   1
    \end{bmatrix}   \label{eq:rbl5a} \\
    \mathbf{T^B_5}_b &= \mathbf{T^B_5} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
        \mathbf{I}_{3 \times 3}     &   [1, 0, 0]^\top   \\
        \mathbf{0}_{1 \times 3}     &   1
    \end{bmatrix} \label{eq:rbl5b}
\end{align}

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{_content/30_quasiStatic/3D/fig_vResult.png}
        \caption{$\vec{AB}_a(\mathbf{q})$ and $\vec{AB}_b(\mathbf{q})$}
        \label{fig:3D_result}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:3D_result} includes all the vectors from the previous figure, and determines
the vectors $\vec{AB}_a$ and $\vec{AB}_b$ by subtracting the corresponding position.

Initially $\vec{AB}_a$ and $\vec{AB}_b$ are unit vectors constructed from $\vec{r}^{B}_{5}$.
As $\vec{AB}_a$ and $\vec{AB}_b$ are constructed with respect to the 
base coordinate system, they will cease to be unit vectors upon any change in orientation of $\vec{r}^{B}_{5}$. 
Upon taking the dot product of $\vec{AB}_a$ and either unit vector, $\mathbf{e_x}$ or $\mathbf{e_z}$, if 
the result is zero, then then $\vec{AB}_a$ is perpendicular to the corresponding unit vector.
If $\vec{AB}_a$ is perpendicular to both, the torso of the robot is perpendicular to both 
unit vectors. As $\vec{AB}_a$ is a function of $\mathbf{q}$, the result of the dot product 
with the unit vectors was used as a pair of nonlinear equality constraints for the three 
dimensional IKM. Thus the IKM is now subjected to the inequality constraint found in equation 
\ref{eq:2D_ineq} in addition to the equality constraints found in equations \ref{eq:3D_eqc1} and \ref{eq:3D_eqc2}.

\begin{align}
    \mathbf{e_x}^{\top}\vec{AB}_a &= 0  \label{eq:3D_eqc1} \\
    \mathbf{e_z}^{\top}\vec{AB}_a &= 0  \label{eq:3D_eqc2}
\end{align}
