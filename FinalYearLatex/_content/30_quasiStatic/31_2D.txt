The two-dimensional model is used to initially investigate quasistatic locomotion,
as the model is less complex than its three-dimensional counterparts. The experience 
gained in solving the inverse kinematic problem for two-dimensional step trajectories, 
transitioning between the kinematic chains and shifting the CoM between steps, invaluable when 
moving to modelling in three dimensions.

\subsubsection*{Two Dimensional Inverse Kinematic Model}

The two-dimensional inverse kinematic Model (IKM) is a quadratic optimisation function solving for the 
array of joint variables, $\mathbf{q}$, that minimise the equation~\eqref{eq:2D_ikm}. Weights, 
$\mathbf{K_q}$, $\mathbf{K_e}$, and $\mathbf{K_{CoM}}$, penalise the change in joint variables, the
end effector error and the displacement of the ground projected CoM from the centre of the support polygon.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:2D_ikm}
    \mathbf{q^{*}} = \underset{\mathbf{q}}{\mathrm{\arg\:\min}}\:\:
    \mathbf{K_{e}}            \lVert  {    k(\mathbf{q}) - \mathbf{x_{e}^*}                         } \rVert \: + \\
    \mathbf{K_{CoM}}          \lVert  {    \mathbf{r^{B}_{SP}} - \mathbf{r^{B}_{CoM}}(\mathbf{q})   } \rVert \: + \\
    \mathbf{K_{q}}            \lVert  {    \mathbf{q_{0}} - \mathbf{q}                              } \rVert \:
\end{equation}

The FKM, $k(\mathbf{q})$, is the core element of the Inverse Kinematic Model.
The FKM produces the pose of the end effector, as a function of $\mathbf{q}$, with 
respect to the base. The IKM is a function of the end effector's pose, 
$\mathbf{x_{e}}$, and returns the array of $\mathbf{q}$ necessary to $\mathbf{x_{e}}$. Thus, 
when given a desired pose, $\mathbf{x_{e}^*}$, the IKM returns the optimal $\mathbf{q^{*}}$ in order
to achieve it. \\

The position of the ground projected CoM with respect to the base coordinate system, $\mathbf{r^{B}_{CoM}}$, 
is subtracted from the position of the centre of the support polygon, $\mathbf{r^{B}_{SP}}$. 
Given sufficient time, the displacement between these two points will become zero. \\ 

$\mathbf{q_{0}}$ is the previous array of optimal joint variables. Without penalising the change in 
joint angles, the new optimal joint variables, $\mathbf{q^{*}}$, could yield large changes 
in the value of the joint angles. When considered in the context of time and position, this would have resulted in the 
acceleration of elements that form the kinematic chain, thus violating the `quasistatic assumption'.
Similarly, to prevent the CoM from accelerating beyond minimal velocities the IKM is subject to the nonlinear inequality
constraint, found in equation~\eqref{eq:2D_ineq}, where $\Delta_{t}$ is the time step of the system. This prevents the CoM from
traveling more than $0.1 metres$ per second in any linear direction, thus remaining slow enough to ignore inertial effects.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:2D_ineq}
    \frac{\lvert\: \mathbf{r^{B}_{CoM}} (\mathbf{q}) - \mathbf{r^{B}_{CoM}}(\mathbf{q0}) \:\rvert }{\Delta_{t}}  - \mathbf{1 \times 10^{-1}}_{3 \times 1} \leq \mathbf{0}_{3 \times 1}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Footstep Trajectory Generation}
The footstep trajectory is generated using ODEs, similarly to projectile motion.
Given an initial position, $\mathbf{r_i}$, final position, $\mathbf{r_f}$, desired step height, $y_{d}$, 
and time span, $t_i \to t_f$, the trajectory, $\mathbf{r}(t)$, is generated by solving two second order 
differential equations. The $y$ component of both the initial and final positions is zero, as the 
robot is stepping along the plane $y = 0$.
In $x$ no acceleration is desired, while in $y$ there is some unknown acceleration, $a_y$, which 
is necessary to return the foot to the ground within the desired time period.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:2D_accel}
    \mathbf{\ddot r}(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
            0   \\
        -a_{y}
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

The indefinite integral of equation~\eqref{eq:2D_accel} is $\mathbf{\dot r}(t) + \mathbf{b}$, 
where $\mathbf{b}$ is some unknown constant. At time $\frac{1}{2}(t_i + t_f)$, halfway along
the trajectory, the $y$ component of $\mathbf{\dot r}(t)$ must be zero, ceasing the foot's vertical 
velocity. Concurrently, the $x$ component of $\mathbf{\dot r}(t)$ is $0 + b_{x}$ and thus $b_{x}$
is set to the average velocity.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:2D_vel}
    \mathbf{\dot r}(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
        v_{x}(t) \\
        v_{y}(t)
    \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
        \frac{x_f - x_i}{t_f - t_i} \\
       -a_{y} \, t + b_{y}
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Equation~\eqref{eq:2D_vel} is indefinitely integrated to yield $\mathbf{r}(t) + \mathbf{c}$, where 
$\mathbf{c}$ is some unknown constant.
The $y$ component of the trajectory contains three unknown variables, $a_{y}$, $b_{y}$ and $c_{y}$.
As the robot is stepping along the plane $y = 0$, it is evident that $c_{y} = 0$. To solve the remaining 
coefficients the $y$ component of the trajectory is set to the desired step height halfway along 
the trajectory.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:2D_solve}
    y_{d} = -\frac{1}{2} a_{y} {(\frac{1}{2}(t_i + t_f))}^{2} + b_{y} \, (\frac{1}{2}(t_i + t_f))
\end{equation}

Substituting $b_{y} = a_{y}(\frac{1}{2}(t_i + t_f))$ into equation~\eqref{eq:2D_solve}
yields the coefficients $a_{y}$ and $b_{y}$. As the $x$ component of the trajectory must equal 
the $x$ component of the initial position at time $t_i$, it follows that $c_{x} = x_i$.
This lead to equation~\eqref{eq:2D_pos} which paramterises the path of a stepping foot as
a function of time.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:2D_pos}
    \mathbf{r}(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
        x(t)    \\
        y(t)    
    \end{bmatrix} = \mathbf{r_i}(t_i) + \begin{bmatrix}
        t \, \frac{x_f - x_i}{t_f - t_i}     \\
        4 t \frac{y_{d}}{(t_i + t_f)} (1 - \frac{t}{t_i + t_f}) 
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Initialising $t_i$ as zero and $t_f$ as the duration of the step, $t_d$, leads to~\eqref{eq:2D_qt}.
During footstep trajectory generation the time span must now begin at zero time, and finishes
at time $t_d$. The trajectory matrix, $\mathbf{Q_s}_{2 \times n}(t)$, consists of rows of position vectors describing
the path with respect to some origin. This path can be iterated through at any time, and 
can be shifted in time, during the execution of the walking cycle.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:2D_qt}
    \mathbf{Q_s}(0 \: \to \: t_d) = \mathbf{r_i}(t_i) + \begin{bmatrix}
        t \, \frac{x_f - x_i}{t_d}     \\
        4 t \frac{y_{d}}{(t_d)} (1 - \frac{t}{t_d}) 
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Implementation}

The two-dimensional model is initialised with $ \mathbf{q_{0}} = 
{[\frac{-\pi}{8}, \frac{2\pi}{8}, \frac{-\pi}{8}, \frac{\pi}{8}, \frac{-2\pi}{8}, \frac{\pi}{8}]}^\top$. This
resulted in the model standing with slightly bent knees, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:2D_init}. For simplicity, the rotations associated with
the end effector pose set to zero. The model ran at $40Hz$ for 24 seconds,
with the steps at 0, 8 and 16 seconds. The width of the support polygon, chosen as $0.1 metres$.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{_content/30_quasiStatic/2D/fig_init.png}
        \caption{Initialised 2D model.}\label{fig:2D_init}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

To shift between kinematic chains, a parameter called $STEP$ is established. $STEP$ took values of $-1$ or $1$ depending on 
which foot to be in motion. This 
approach is based on the relationship between the dual kinematic chains, as seen in equation~\eqref{eq:STEP}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:STEP}
    {(\mathbf{T}^{Left}_{Right})}^{1} = {(\mathbf{T}^{Right}_{Left})}^{-1}
\end{equation}

\input{_content/30_quasiStatic/AlgRun.txt}

As the matrix inverse is computationally expensive, $\emph{if}$ statements are used to switch between 
the kinematic chains within the FKM function. The position of the left sole, and position of the right sole, are tracked with
global two-dimensional arrays, as seen in algorithm~\ref{alg:2D_run}. \\

The trajectory followed by each step is designed using 
equation~\eqref{eq:2D_pos}. Rather than a dedicated, parallel kinematic chain and IKM to shift the CoM between steps, 
the step duration is halved during step trajectory generation algorithm. 
The initial half of the step time period is used to shift the CoM to the fixed foot, while the remainder
stepped the foot. This is achieved by populating the first half of the trajectory matrix, $\mathbf{Q}$, with the 
initial position of the end effector, $\mathbf{r}_i = \mathbf{x_e}$. Thus, the trajectory 
passed, as $\mathbf{x_e^*}$, the initial position of the end effector. This kept the stepping foot in 
its initial position for half the time period of the step, while the CoM shifted to the opposite foot.

\input{_content/30_quasiStatic/AlgTrajgen.txt}

It should be noted that algorithm~\ref{alg:2D_trajGen} drops the $t_i$ term from equation~\eqref{eq:2D_pos}, and 
generates a parabolic trajectory from an initial time of zero, to the final time $+t_d$. This trajectory
then shifted to the second half of the step time period using $\mathbf{TT}$.

The IKM is a direct implementation of equation~\eqref{eq:2D_ikm} and nonlinear constraint~\eqref{eq:2D_ineq}, 
with weights found in equations~\eqref{eq:2D_w2} to~\eqref{eq:2D_w3}. The large penalty associated with the end effector error, $\mathbf{K_e}$,
forces the solver to primarily satisfy the pose of the end effector.
The initial value passed to the numerical solver at each time index,
is the previous set of optimal joint values, $\mathbf{q}_{(i-1)}$. At each time index, the corresponding
index of the step trajectory, passed as the desired position component of the pose, $\mathbf{r_{E}^B}^{*}_{i}$.
Concurrently, the rotational components, $\phi_x$ and $\theta_y$, are set to zero.

\begin{align}
    \mathbf{K_e}            &= 1  \times 10^{4} \cdot \mathbf{I}_{4\times4} \label{eq:2D_w1} \\ 
    \mathbf{K_q}            &= 1                \cdot \mathbf{I}_{6\times6} \label{eq:2D_w2} \\ 
    \mathbf{K_{CoM}}        &= 1  \times 10^{3} \cdot \mathbf{I}_{1\times1} \label{eq:2D_w3}
\end{align}

The position of the centre of the support line, $\mathbf{r^{B}_{SP}}$, is updated as 
a function of the $STEP$ variable. It is set to the position of the sole right foot, 
$\mathbf{r^B_r}$, when $STEP = 1$, and the position of the sole of the left foot, $\mathbf{r^B_l}$,
when $STEP = -1$. These positions are the bases of the kinematic chains from right to left, and from 
left to right, respectively. \\
As the returned $\mathbf{q^*}_{i}$ may not result in the exact desire pose, $\mathbf{x_{e}^*}_{i}$, the optimal joint variables passed through the FKM to determine the true pose of the end effector.

\subsubsection*{MATLAB Simulation Results}

Figure~\ref{fig:2D_traj} depicts the paths traveled by both feet, with the left foot in red,
and the right foot in blue. These paths generated by algorithm~\ref{alg:2D_trajGen} as 
trajectories, with a step height of $0.1 metres$ and step distance of $0.25$ metres. Both feet
began from the origin, which is verified in Figure~\ref{fig:2D_CoM}.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=.95\linewidth]{_content/30_quasiStatic/2D/fig_path.png}
        \caption{2D paths for feet}\label{fig:2D_traj}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

On the right of Figure~\ref{fig:2D_CoM} the position of the feet shown with respect to time, left in red,
right in blue. At $t = 4$ seconds, the right foot begins stepping, completing its path by $t = 8$ seconds. Between 
$t = 8$ seconds and $t = 12$ seconds, it is evident that the robot is in the double support phase as there is no 
change in the displacement of the left or right foot. This occurs once again at $t = 16$ seconds. During these
double support phases the CoM transitions from one foot to the other at a near constant velocity. This is 
clearly seen on the left side of Figure~\ref{fig:2D_CoM}.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=.95\linewidth]{_content/30_quasiStatic/2D/fig_CoM.png}
        \caption{2D model CoM and foot positions}\label{fig:2D_CoM}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

During single support phases, it is also clear that the CoM remains firmly between the bounds
of the support polygon. Thus, with the CoM remaining between the bounds of the support polygon for
all time, the two-dimensional model has successfully demonstrated quasistatic locomotion.
