The two dimensional model was used to initially investigate quasistatic locomotion,
as the model was less complex than its three dimensional counterparts. The experience 
gained in solving the inverse kinematic problem for two dimensional trajectories, 
transitioning between the kinematic chains and shifting the CoM between steps, was
found to be invaluable when moving to three dimensions.

\subsubsection*{Footstep Trajectory Generation}
The a foot step trajectory was generated using ODEs?, similar to projectile motion.
Given an inital position, $\mathbf{r_i}$, final position, $\mathbf{r_f}$, desired step height, $y_{d}$, 
and time span, $t_i \to t_f$, the trajectory, $\mathbf{r}(t)$, was generated by solving two second order 
differential equations. The $y$ component of both the inital and final positions is zero, as the 
robot is stepping along the plane $y = 0$.
In $x$ no acceleration was desired, while in $y$ there was some unknown acceleration, $a_y$, which 
was necessary to return the foot to the ground within the desired time period.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:2D_accel}
    \mathbf{\ddot r}(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
            0   \\
        -a_{y}
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

The indefinite integral of equation \ref{eq:2D_accel} is $\mathbf{\dot r}(t) + \mathbf{b}$, 
where $\mathbf{b}$ is some unknown constant. At time $\frac{1}{2}(t_i + t_f)$, halfway along
the trajectory, the $y$ component of $\mathbf{\dot r}(t)$ must be zero, ceasing the foot's vertical 
velocity. Concurrently, the $x$ component of $\mathbf{\dot r}(t)$ was $0 + b_{x}$ and thus $b_{x}$
was set to the average velocity.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:2D_vel}
    \mathbf{\dot r}(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
        v_{x}(t) \\
        v_{y}(t)
    \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
        \frac{x_f - x_i}{t_f - t_i} \\
       -a_{y} \, t + b_{y}
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:2D_vel} was indefinitely integrated to yield $\mathbf{r}(t) + \mathbf{c}$, where 
$\mathbf{c}$ is some unknown constant.
The $y$ component of the trajectory contains three unknown variables, $a_{y}$, $b_{y}$ and $c_{y}$.
The robot is stepping along the plane $y = 0$ and thus, it is known that $c_{y} = 0$. To solve this coefficients
the $y$ component of the trajectory was to the desired step height halfway along the trajectory.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:2D_solve}
    y_{d} = -\frac{1}{2} a_{y} (\frac{1}{2}(t_i + t_f))^{2} + b_{y} \, (\frac{1}{2}(t_i + t_f))
\end{equation}

Substituting $b_{y} = a_{y}(\frac{1}{2}(t_i + t_f))$ into equation \ref{eq:2D_solve}
yields coefficients $a_{y}$ and $b_{y}$. As the $x$ component of the trajectory must equal 
the $x$ component of the inital position. This lead to equation \ref{eq:2D_pos} which 
describes the trajectory of stepping foot.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:2D_pos}
    \mathbf{r}(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
        x(t)    \\
        y(t)    
    \end{bmatrix} = \mathbf{r_i} + \begin{bmatrix}
        t \, \frac{x_f - x_i}{t_f - t_i}     \\
        4 t \frac{y_{d}}{(t_i + t_f)} (1 - \frac{t}{t_i + t_f}) 
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
