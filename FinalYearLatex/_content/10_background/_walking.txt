The walking problem is solved using either a statically stable or dynamically stable approach. Both rely 
on concepts such as the centre of mass and the support polygon, and consist of a repeating cycle of 
stages.


\subsubsection*{Centre of Mass}
The centre of mass (CoM) is the weighted sum of the position of each mass in the system, which is then divided 
by the total mass of the system.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:CoM}
    \vec{r_{CoM}} = \frac{ \sum\limits_{i=1}^{i=N} m_{i} \, \vec{r_i} } { \sum\limits_{i=1}^{i=N} m_{i} }
\end{equation}

Figure \ref{fig:CoM} presents a physical representation of equation \ref{eq:CoM}, with the symbol pointed to
by $\vec{r_{CoM}}$ representing the resulting CoM.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection*{Support Polygon}
The support polygon is the area beneath an object defined by the set of points that are fixed to the ground. 
In the case of humanoids, it is the area beneath a single foot when it is parallel to, and placed on, 
the ground. When both feet are parallel to, and touching, the ground the set of outer vertices define 
the support polygon.

        }
        \label{fig:SupportPolygon}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

On the left of figure \ref{fig:SupportPolygon} the right foot, blue, is surrounded by the support 
polygon, green, while the left foot, red, is in motion. Once the left foot step has been completed, 
seen on the right, the support polygon is now constructed by the outer vertices of the feet.


\subsubsection*{Walking stages}
Walking consists of a chain of double support (DS) and single support (SS) stages. During the
double support phase, both feet are in contact with and parallel the ground. During the single
support phase one foot remains fixed to the ground, while the other tracks a trajectory to a 
new position. Figure \ref{fig:WalkingCycle} depicts the walking cycle with the positioning of the 
CoM after each stage. Without this CoM shift, the product of gravity and mass of the robot result in a 
moment that will cause the robot to fall.
