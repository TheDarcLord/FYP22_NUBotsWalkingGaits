The walking problem is solved using either a statically stable or dynamically stable approach. Both rely 
on concepts such as the centre of mass and the support polygon, and consist of a repeating cycle of 
stages.

\subsubsection*{Centre of Mass}
The centre of mass is the weighted sum of the position of each mass in the system, which is then divided 
by the total mass of the system.

\subsubsection*{Support Polygon}
The support polygon is the area defined by a set of points that are fixed to the ground. In the case
of humanoids, it is the area beneath a single foot when it is perpendicular to, and placed on, the ground. 
When both feet are perpendicular to, and touching, the ground the set of outer vertices define the support
polygon.
