A path is a \citep{grimble_2009_robotics} purely geometric object such as a line or function, while
a trajectory a path defined as a function of time.

\subsubsection*{Polynomial Splines}
Polynomial splines is the most common method of defining a trajectory through a set of waypoints.

\subsubsection*{Initial Value Problems / Boundary Value Problem | Second Order Differential Equation?}
For simple point to point trajectories THE ABOVE is well suited for generating a concise trajectory.
\begin{align}
    \ddot{r}(t) &= a             \\
    \dot{r}(t) &= a\,t + b  \\
    r(t) &= a\,\frac{t^2}{2} + b\,t + c 
\end{align}
