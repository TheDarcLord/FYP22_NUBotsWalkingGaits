Unlike WeBots, the server established on the robot cannot ignore the passing of time. As such
the select socket function is used to poll for incoming connections from the Matlab client.

Seen below in figure \ref{fig:Real1} is the current Nugus robot in comparison with the WeBots model. 
Of particular note is the differing geometry of the legs. As such, the models that successful ran in WeBots
had to be slightly modified in order to achieve locomotion. The WeBots model depicted here has
been initialised with the joint variable array found in \eqref{eq:3D_JA_INIT}. The Nugus Robot on the
the other hand has been initialised with;

\begin{equation}\label{eq:3D_JA_INIT}
    \mathbf{q_0} = [-\frac{5.5\pi}{180}, \: -\frac{\pi}{12}, \: \frac{\pi}{6}, \: -\frac{\pi}{12}, \: \frac{5.5\pi}{180}, \: 0,
    0, \: \frac{5.5\pi}{180}, \: \frac{\pi}{12}, \: -\frac{\pi}{6}, \: \frac{\pi}{12}, \: -\frac{5.5\pi}{180}]^\top .
\end{equation}

Figure \ref{fig:Real2} depicts the CoM, in red, for both the Webots model and the Nugus robot. To achieve this
similarity, the $X$ position of the CoM in the matlab model was shifted backwards by $0.02$ metres.

Unfortunately, two issues prevented the Nugus robot from walking. Firstly, the knee servos are 
far too weak to be able to single handedly support the mass of the robot for more than a few seconds.
As such, the only way to execute a quasistatic walk would be implementing a walking solution on the robot itself.
Quasistatic locomotion is inherently slow, and thus any attempt at a rapid quasistatic walk would take
too long to develop by trial and error. Secondly, although the frequency at which the Nugus server applied 
the joint variables to the servos was defined, the communication lag consistently led to the robot
executing the joint values infrequently. Thus, any attempt at a dynamically stable walk would fail by default as 
gravity or the inertia of the robot would cause a fall while waiting for a subsequent array of joint variables.
However, as it is possible to statically balance the robot by sending the joint variable array over TCP, this 
bridge between matlab and the Nugus platform has some promise.
