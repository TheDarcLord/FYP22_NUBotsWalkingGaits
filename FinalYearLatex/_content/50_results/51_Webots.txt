The WeBots server is conveniently constructed such that time within the WeBots 
simulation pauses, as the server awaits a new set of joint variables.

The following figures are a result of the joint variables generated during the 
execution of the three dimensional quasistatic model in Section \ref{sec:3D_QS},
and the execution of the dynamically stable model in Section \ref{sec:ZMP_imp}.

As a reminder, the three dimensional model is run along a sinusoidal trajectory
with a system frequency of 40Hz. Figure~\ref{fig:Res_QS} depicts the 
WeBots model successfully walking using the quasistatic method, with the frames read
from left to right. Close inspection reveals the CoM represented as a pale green cross
within a green support polygon. The frames demonstrate stepping of with both the left and 
right feet during the single support phase, as well shifting the CoM during the 
double support phase.

Similarly, the dynamically stable three dimensional mode is run along 
a sinusoidal trajectory with the same geometry as the former. Figure~\ref{fig:Res_ZMP} depicts the 
WeBots model successfully walking using the Zero Moment Point, with the frames read
from left to right. While the CoM remains within the support polygon at all times during
quasistatic locomotion, it rarely enters the support polygon during dynamically stable 
locomotion. Close inspection of these frames will see a red support polygon beneath the 
feet, indicating that the CoM is within it. Unfortunately, WeBots does not track the ZMP.
However, as the robot manages to travel closer and closer to the centre of the field without falling, it 
can be assumed that the ZMP is within the support polygon.
