This is one of the most important parts of the report. In the conclusion section, you  %should 
\begin{itemize}
\item briefly summarise the results,
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Simulation of Quasi Static in Webots -> Flawless
        \item Simulation of ZMP in WeBots -> Somewhat Successful
        \item Quasi Static on NuGus -> Evident robot cannot run `QuasiStatic`
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Metal Legs are a different geometry to plastic Legs -> Model Change
                \item Servos at Hip Knee and Ankle joints significantly under powered -> Hit 80 degrees and collapse
                \item Backlash in Servos not account for, but significant -> 1-2 degrees, joint values: 0.06 degree increments (rad to decimal places)
                \item Mass over a single foot not possible for slow quasi static walk
                \item Fast quasistatic possible, however, tiny steps, rapid shifting of mass
                \item TCP IP Communication Lag fluctuation -> 500ms, method would need to be modified to send all values, and then run them
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\item reflect on the work presented, 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Lack of torso model -> some impact, arms could have been used to shift CoM (quite heavy 300g+)
        \item New Trajectory Method useful, particularly in the Hobbyist space
        \item True mass positions for model would have been useful, however 3 different models makes that a little hard
        \item True geometry (metal legs) may have improved result, however, metal legs have only been implemented in the final few weeks. Have not been documented in Onshape.
        \item Jacobian + Differential Kinematics = MatLab Sim with Gravity
        \item QuasiStatic approach somewhat novel, but Successful
        \item ZMP frequency trade off vs Actuator penalty vs Computation time
    \end{itemize}
\item make recommendations,
    \begin{itemize}
        \item DOCUMENT THE ROBOT's GEOMETRY AND KEEP IT UP TO DATE
        \item DOCUMENT THE ROBOT'S MASS AND KEEP IT UP TO DATE
        \item REPLACE SERVO MOTORS with more powerful models
        \item MODEL SERVO Backlash
        \item Use trajectory method as interim solution, after replacing servos -> GoTo (position) on field -> With quasi static -> Large Footsteps!!
        \item Reactions at feet measured -> foot Torque / Force sensors -> CoM less blind, more accurate, tuned -> reactive ZMP
    \end{itemize}
