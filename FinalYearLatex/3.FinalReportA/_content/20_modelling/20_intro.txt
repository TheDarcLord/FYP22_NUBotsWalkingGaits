Each model is a simplistic representation of a bipedal robot. 
As the focus is simulating different walking strategies, each model is comprised of the
lower half of a humanoid, that being the feet, legs and waist. Both models were 
constructed via a series of homogenous transforms that describe the postions of each ankle in
global coordinates.
