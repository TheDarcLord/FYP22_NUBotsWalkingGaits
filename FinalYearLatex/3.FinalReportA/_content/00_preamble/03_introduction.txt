To organise your introduction section you can use the following structure:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Position}: Show there is a problem and that it is important to solve it.
    \item \textbf{Problem}: Describe the specifics of the problem you are trying to address
    \item \textbf{Proposal}: Discuss how you are going to address this problem. Use the literature to back-up your approach to the problem, or to highlight that what you are doing has not been done before
\end{itemize}
Here you need to sell why what you are doing is important, and what benefits will it bring if you are successful and solve the problem?
