In this section, examples of equations, figures, lists and code are provided.

\subsubsection{Mathematics}
\LaTeX \ is very good for writing equations. Equations can be included in-line by using the \$ symbols $y=m x + h$. Alternatively, equations can be written separately by using the \verb|equation| environment---see \eqref{eq:EquationLine} below.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:EquationLine}
    y=m x + h.
\end{equation}
When you use the \verb|equaiton|, the expressions will be automatically numbered. If you do not want a number to be assigned, include an asterisk * when beginning the equation environment:
\begin{equation*}
    z=m_z x^2 + h_z.
\end{equation*}
The split command can be used within an equation environment to separate equations over multiple lines. Use an ampersand \& on each line to specify how the equations should be aligned. Using split only provides a single equation number for multiple lines.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SS1}
    \begin{split}
        \dot x &= Ax + Bu, \\
        y &= Cx + Du.
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
If you want to have each line of a multi-line equation numbered, you can make used of the \verb|align| environment,
\begin{align}
    \dot x &= Ax + Bu,  \label{eq:State} \\
    y &= Cx + Du, \label{eq:Output} 
\end{align}
where \eqref{eq:State} is the first equation and \eqref{eq:Output} is the second. If you want to distinguish vectors from scalars you can use \textbf{bold} for vectors and matrices:
\begin{equation*} 
    \begin{split}
        \dot{\mathbf{x}} &= \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{B} u, \\
        y &= \mathbf{C} \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{D} u,
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}
where $u$ and $y$ are scalar variables and $\mathbf{x}$ is a vector variable.

Matrices can be written by using the \verb|bmatrix| command:
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{A} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        A_{11} & A_{12} & \dots & &A_{1n} \\
        A_{21} & A_{22} &  \dots & &\vdots \\
        \vdots & \vdots & \ddots& &  \vdots\\
        A_{m1} & A_{m2} & \dots & &A_{mn}
    \end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation*}

Greek letters can be written within equations by using appropriate commands. A few useful examples are:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\alpha, \beta$
\item $\gamma, \Gamma$
\item $\theta, \Theta$
\item $\phi, \Phi, \varphi$
\end{itemize}
You can also write Greek letters in bold using the \verb|boldsymbol| command: $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$.

\subsubsection{Figures}
Figures can be included in your document by using the \verb|figure| environment. Note that the position of the figure is decided by the latex compiler when creating the final document. Don't be surprised if it does not appear exactly where you expected it.  below shows a plot of the function $\sin(x)/x$.

Figures can be created using your favourite graphics editor before being included in your LaTeX document. If I need to make a simple diagram, I use powerpoint and select the drawing and save it as a pdf. For example, look at 
To import the figures from Matlab, follow the following procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Add labels and legends (don't forget to include units in the labels of each axis.)
    \item From the file menu tag on the figure select export set up
    \item Change the font size to 14 and click apply to figure
    \item Export the figure as eps
    \item Import it in LaTeX using the include graphics within a \verb|figure| environment.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Lists}
To create lists use the environments \verb|itemize|, \verb|enumerate|, or \verb|description|

The following is generated using \emph{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This is item 1 
    \item This is item 2
\end{itemize}
%
The following is generated using \emph{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}[1)]
    \item This is item 1 
    \begin{enumerate}[a)]
        \item Subitem a
        \item Subitem b
        \begin{enumerate}[i)]
            \item Subsubitem i
            \item Subsubitem ii
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item This is item 2
\end{enumerate}
%
The following is generated using \emph{description}
\begin{description}
    \item[foo)] This is item 1 
    \item[bar)] This is item 2
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Code listings}

To include a syntax-highlighted code listing, you can use the \emph{listings} package. The default options are specified by the \verb|\lstset| command. The default settings for this document have been configured for Matlab code. There are 3 main commands, all of which can include options to override the defaults:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \verb|\lstinline|: Command for including code fragments inline with the text, as an alternative to \verb|\verb|. For example, we might describe function prototypes such as \lstinline[style=CStyle,breaklines=true]|int main(int argc, char *argv[])|.
    
    \item \verb|\begin{lstlisting}|,\ldots,\verb|\end{lstlisting}|: Environment for including a source code listing---embedded in the LaTeX source---in a box or floating environment.
	\begin{lstlisting}
	figure(1)
	hold on
	grid on
	% Plot the input voltage
	plot(time,voltage)
	% Plot the recovered voltage
	plot(time,Ra*current + Kw*velocity,'+')
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	The default style can be changed using the \texttt{style} command. A \texttt{CStyle} option has been defined within this temple for \texttt{.c} code.
	\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
	int add_function(int x, int y)
	{
	    /* Add inputs and return value */
	    return x+y;
	}
	\end{lstlisting}
	
    \item \verb|\lstinputlisting|: Command for including a source code listing---loaded from an external file---in a box or floating environment. An example is shown in Listing~\ref{lst:matlabserial}.
\end{enumerate}
