## 2022 Final Year Project
### TwoDimensions
#### Status: Quasi Static 
- 2 Steps with CoM shift between steps
- Displaying CoM
- CoM sticks to planted foot, and transitions to the forward foot during a dual support phase
- Quintic Splines for Trajectory Generation
- Trajectories: Feet/Ankles, CoM during dual support
- Pseudo Optimised, runtime ~ 50 sec
- 3D aspects to ease transition to 3D
### ThreeDimensions
#### Status:
- Multiple Steps with CoM shift between steps
- Displaying CoM in 3D, lacking 2D 'shadow'
- CoM sticks to planted foot, and transitions to the forward foot during a dual support phase
- Quintic Splines for Trajectory Generation
- Trajectories: Feet/Ankles, CoM during dual support
- Pseudo Optimised, runtime ~ 500 sec
