### **_Formative**
Formative contains a collection of MATLAB examples. Each of these run independently.
### **NUgus_Global_Quasi**
Simulation of NUbots' original robot using the *Quasistatic* approach to walking. Global Coordinates means the position of each **End Effector** (The *Left* and *Right* Foot) is tracked for all time. Thus, when plotted, 
the NUgus travels from the **zero** position to the end of an arbitrary trajectory. Global simulations run slowly as these are relatively large variables, repeatedly stored and accessed.
